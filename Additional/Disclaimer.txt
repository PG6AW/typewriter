And thus, i would love to appreciate CAPCOM as i highly admire and value their works especially the Resident Evil series and the picture i have used in my project, is derived from Resident Evil 2 remake 2019, a very popular video game from CAPCOM that i have even named the project after the beloved character, Leon S Kennedy!
When i was looking for some images to use for my project, on the internet, i found this one to be the only one flagged as "Free to Use, modify and share" so i picked this one which was from my favorite game of Resident Evil 2 that made my days and memories eversince my childhood!
